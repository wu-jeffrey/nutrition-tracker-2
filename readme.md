Trackit is a web-based application that simplifies the nutrition tracking process by removing unecessary elements and condesing all you need into one page.

## Structure
The code is currently split into two distinct sections, `client` and `server`, pertaining to front- and back- ends accordingly. The plan is to eventually split these folders into two repositories to enable the creation of multiple client applications, (e.g. Android or iOS app).
Further information pertaining to each section is available in `readme`s found in each subfolder. 

## Current Stack

### Frontend
* React
* Material UI

### Backend
* Node.js w/ Express
* MongoDB

### Testing
* Mocha
* Chai
* Mockgoose (should swap this out b/c its being deprecated)
* Supertest for HTTP calls
